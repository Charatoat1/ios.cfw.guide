## Saving blobs automatically
1. Open your package manager
1. Search for the "shshd" package
1. Download and install the package
1. Tap "Done" when prompted

Blobs will automatically be saved when you download shshd, every time you rejailbreak, and every week after that. The blobs are available at the [TSS saver website](https://tsssaver.1conan.com/v2/), in order to retrieve them, go to "retrieve" and put in your ECID.

## Running shshd manually

You shouldn't need to run shshd manually, but it can be run through a terminal.

1. SSH into the device or download NewTerm 2
1. Type ```sudo /usr/sbin/shshd``` into the terminal
  - If prompted for a password, enter in your root password (by default this is set to `alpine`)

Once finished, your blobs should be saved and the program should output a link to where you can download them.
