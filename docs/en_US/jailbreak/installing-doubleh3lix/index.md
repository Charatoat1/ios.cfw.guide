doubleh3lix is capable of jailbreaking every 64bit iOS device with a headphone jack on firmware version 10.0 up to 10.3.3.

Note that the doubleh3lix jailbreak is [not “persistent”](/types-of-jailbreak/#semi-untethered-jailbreaks) (meaning it does not remain installed after a reboot). You will need to re-run the exploit after every reboot. You will be instructed on how to do this.

Due to how custom applications are installed to the device, in most cases you will need to reinstall the doubleh3lix jailbreak application to your device every 7 days from your computer.

We will use the AltDeploy tool to install the doubleh3lix jailbreak application to your iOS device for use in the next step.
